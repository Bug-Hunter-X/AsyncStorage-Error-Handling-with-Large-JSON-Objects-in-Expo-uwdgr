# AsyncStorage Error Handling with Large JSON Objects in Expo

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using AsyncStorage in Expo applications to store large JSON objects. The problem arises from the limitations and intricacies of AsyncStorage's handling of complex data structures. This often leads to unexpected behavior, such as data corruption, loss, or app crashes without clear error messages.

## Problem Description

AsyncStorage in Expo isn't designed for storing extremely large amounts of data or deeply nested JSON objects. Attempting to do so often results in silent failures or crashes.  The main challenge is identifying the root cause and implementing effective error handling.

## Solution

The primary solution involves breaking down large JSON objects into smaller, more manageable chunks before storage, and reassembling them upon retrieval. This approach prevents AsyncStorage from exceeding its limitations.

Furthermore, implementing robust error handling with try...catch blocks can mitigate unexpected crashes and provide more informative debugging information.  Additional strategies may involve choosing alternative storage mechanisms, like SQLite, for larger datasets.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
3. Run the app and attempt to store a large JSON object.
4. Observe the behavior and errors.
