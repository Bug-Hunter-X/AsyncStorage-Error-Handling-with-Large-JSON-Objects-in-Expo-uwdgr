This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo and is related to the way AsyncStorage handles large amounts of data or complex objects.  The error message might not be explicitly clear, but it often manifests as unexpected behavior, such as data loss, incorrect data retrieval, or app crashes.  The underlying cause is usually a serialization or deserialization issue, particularly when storing large JSON objects or arrays.  This can be exacerbated by the way AsyncStorage manages its internal storage mechanisms and limits.
